Have you ever been asked to make a web map and not really known where to start? Has your boss asked you to make a quick map to show on a news site. but you didn't know how? If so, this is the meetup for you!

For this meetup, we will be discussing how to make a simple web map with some basic markers and popups using Leaflet.js. We will cover the basics of what Leaflet is, how to use it, and make a simple web map together step by step.

There are a couple things to keep in mind. The first is that this meetup expects you to have a basic understanding of Javascript, Javascript libraries, and how to use them. Also, please remember to bring your computers so you can code along as we go through!
