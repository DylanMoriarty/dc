This month we'll start to venture through the weeds of geospatial data--the containers of geographic information. We'll explore the main data types and discover how they compare.  

Some questions we'll cover: What are the main differences between vector and raster data? What are the use cases for different types of data? What's a shapefile and why does it have 4+ files within it? What's best for web maps? How do we convert it? Where can I find this data in the first place?  

After this Maptime you'll be well on your way to become a vector detector or a raster master!  

Beginners strongly encouraged! Please bring a laptop so we can get hands-on into the nitty gritty of geospatial data.
