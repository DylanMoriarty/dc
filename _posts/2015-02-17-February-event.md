We will be joining the folks from [MissingMaps](http://www.missingmaps.org/) for a Mardi Gras themed mapathon. This will be a great opportunity to learn more about OpenStreetMap and to contribute some work to very needy causes. 

You need to register via the [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/mardi-gras-missing-maps-mapathon-washington-dc-tickets-15505673888) page for this, not just here on Meetup, so be sure to do that! 

Show up at 5:30 to learn all about mapping & contributing to OpenStreetMap or just come at 6pm to contribute to the mapping party! There will also be fun Mardi Gras themed goodies, including King Cake!

And as always, beginners VERY welcome and please bring a Laptop!
