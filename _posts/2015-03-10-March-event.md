Tim Abdella, GIO for the Government of the District of Columbia, will talk about the Districtâ€™s open GIS data site http://data.dc.gov -- the 600+ spatial datasets the District has available for anyone to use for research, analysis, product creation and more! He will also showcase the many geospatial apps and tools the District has built for residents, such as tracking snowplows and finding property information and permits. Come ready to offer your feedback on what you would like to see happening next with DC's GIS data!

Bring a laptop so you can use the data and tools yourself!
